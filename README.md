Image Classification Project Using Teachable Machine


This project focuses on building a simple image classification model to distinguish between two categories using Teachable Machine. I chose this tool because it offers an intuitive interface for creating machine learning models, making it accessible even for beginners. The goal was to develop a model that could classify images accurately with minimal effort and setup.

# How It Works
 1. Data Collection
 • I started by gathering a balanced dataset of images representing the two categories I wanted to classify.
 • Ensuring high-quality and diverse images was a priority to enhance the model’s accuracy.
 2. Uploading Data to Teachable Machine
 • I used the Image Project option in Teachable Machine to upload my dataset.
 • Each category was assigned its own class for training purposes.
 3. Training the Model
 • The tool provided a straightforward training process. After uploading the images, I trained the model with just a few clicks.
 • Teachable Machine’s automated setup handled the model architecture, so I didn’t have to dive into complex configurations.
 4. Testing the Model
 • I tested the model using images outside the training dataset to validate its performance.
 • The results were impressive, with the model achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between the two categories.
 5. Exporting and Deployment
 • Once the model was trained and tested, I used the Export Model feature to integrate it into a web-based or standalone application.
 • The exported model can be run locally or hosted online for real-time predictions.

# How to Use
 • Users can upload an image through the interface, and the model will classify it instantly into one of the two predefined categories.
 • The project is lightweight and straightforward, making it ideal for learning or extending to more complex classification tasks.
